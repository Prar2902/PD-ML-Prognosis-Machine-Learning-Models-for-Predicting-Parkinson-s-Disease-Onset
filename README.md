# PD-ML-Prognosis-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Predicting-Parkinson-s-Disease-Onset
Using voice analysis in diagnosis systems is the need of the hour needed because vocal impairment is one of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease in patients. Biomedical signal processing is one of the important study disciplines today. the output predicted from all the algorithms was compiled to give utmost accurate value for detection.
